a resources folder that contains the csv files you used.  Make sure that your script has the correct path to the csv file.
an analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis 
push these changes to Gibhub or Gitlab


PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
